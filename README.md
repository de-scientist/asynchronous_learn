# **ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT**

* **It is done using promises and initially callbacks**
* **setTimeout() delays execution of the function, making it asynchronous**
* **setInterval**
* **Callbacks- is a function passed as an argument to another function, ensuring that execution happens only after the asynchronous operation is complete.**
* **fetchData() does not wait for the data to be readyâ€”it returns undefined immediately.**
* **Has consuming code which requires the output of the producing code**
* **Promises**
